answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because it features a person skiing on a mountain, which is an exciting and adventurous activity. The image also includes a can of soda, which is a product that many people are familiar with and enjoy. The combination of the adventurous activity and the familiar product creates a visually appealing and engaging advertisement that is likely to capture people's attention.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. It features a diverse range of makeup products, including eyeshadows, lipsticks, and brushes, and it uses a combination of bold colors, text, and images to showcase the products. The left image, while visually appealing, focuses more on the model and the snowy background, which may not be as effective in highlighting the makeup products.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because it features a person skiing on a mountain, which is an exciting and adventurous activity. The image on the left shows a person sitting at a desk using a computer, which is a more mundane and everyday activity. The contrast between the two images, with one depicting an exciting outdoor activity and the other depicting a more sedentary indoor activity, creates a stronger visual impact and is more likely to grab people's attention.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because it features a baby with a Coca-Cola bottle on its head, which is an unusual and eye-catching visual. The baby's innocent and surprised expression adds to the novelty and humor of the advertisement. In contrast, the left image shows a hand holding a can of Coca-Cola, which is a more common and less visually striking scene.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. It features a close-up of a Coca-Cola bottle with a playful octopus wrapped around it, which is an unusual and eye-catching combination. The octopus adds a whimsical and fun element to the advertisement, making it more memorable and engaging than the left image, which appears to be a more straightforward and less visually interesting presentation of a Coca-Cola bottle.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because it features a modern scene with a woman using a laptop, which is a common and relatable activity for many people. The image on the left, on the other hand, features a vintage scene with a man and a child, which may not be as relatable or engaging for a modern audience. The use of a laptop in the right image also suggests that the product being advertised is relevant to contemporary technology and communication.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because it features a unique and unexpected element: a hand holding a beer can. The combination of a human hand with a beer can is not a typical sight, which makes the image stand out. Additionally, the hand is holding the beer can in a way that it appears to be a part of the hand, further adding to the creativity and novelty of the image. The left image, on the other hand, features a more conventional scene with squirrels and a slogan, which may not be as eye-catching or memorable.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative.

The combination of these elements creates a unique and memorable image that is likely to grab people's attention. In contrast, the left image features a hand holding a beer can, which is a more common and less interesting sight. While the hand is holding a beer can, it does not have any other interesting elements to make it stand out.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because it features a unique and eye-catching design, with a person's body made entirely of reflective material, creating a striking contrast against the white background. The use of a single, bold color for the text also helps to draw attention to the message. In contrast, the left image is more straightforward and lacks the same level of visual interest.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because it features a baby's hand holding a smartphone, which is an unusual and eye-catching sight. The baby's hand is placed over a picture of a cityscape, creating a visual connection between the two images. This juxtaposition is likely to pique the viewer's curiosity and make them want to learn more about the product or service being advertised. The left image, on the other hand, features a more traditional cityscape, which may not be as visually striking or memorable.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because it features a man and a woman, which can draw attention due to the contrast between the two. Additionally, the man is wearing sunglasses, which adds an element of intrigue and style. The woman is wearing a black and white outfit, which can also be visually striking. The combination of these elements creates a more dynamic and engaging image compared to the left image, which only features a hand holding a can.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because it features a unique and unexpected element: a hand holding a beer can.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative.

The right image is likely to be more visually appealing and attention-grabbing due to its use of bright colors and the variety of products it showcases.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because it features a cow sitting in front of a laptop, which is an unusual and eye-catching sight. The cow is also holding a laptop, which adds to the uniqueness of the image. The left image, on the other hand, features a variety of makeup products, which is a common sight in advertisements and may not be as eye-catching.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because it features a humorous and unexpected twist: a cow using a laptop. The image is visually striking and memorable, as it combines elements of technology and agriculture in an unusual way. The left image, on the other hand, shows a car, which is a common sight in advertisements and may not be as attention-grabbing.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because it features a humorous and unexpected element: a cow sitting at a desk and using a laptop. The cow's presence in a human-like activity is not only amusing but also unusual, which can make the advertisement more memorable and engaging. In contrast, the left image shows a woman using a laptop, which is a common and less surprising sight.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because it features a unique and eye-catching design with a pattern of squirrels and a green background.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because it features a split image of a woman using a laptop, with the left side of the image mirrored on the right side. This creates a visually interesting and unique effect that is not commonly seen in advertisements. The left image, on the other hand, is a more straightforward and common depiction of a woman using a laptop.

Answer: 2

Explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because it features a man holding a cup of popcorn, which adds a unique and interesting element to the advertisement. The man's presence and the popcorn create a sense of fun and enjoyment, which can make the advertisement more engaging and memorable for the viewer. In contrast, the left image only shows makeup products without any additional elements or storytelling. While the products are important, the lack of creativity in the left image may not be as effective in capturing the viewer's attention and interest.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because it features a man and a woman sitting at a table with a laptop, which creates a sense of interaction and engagement. The man is holding a bowl of food, which adds a unique and interesting element to the advertisement. The combination of the laptop, the people, and the food creates a dynamic and visually appealing scene that is likely to capture the viewer's attention. In contrast, the left image features a man holding a bowl of food, but it lacks the sense of interaction and engagement that the right image has. The man is simply holding the bowl, and there is no other person or object in the image to create a sense of context or story.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because it features a person in a dynamic pose, which adds a sense of movement and energy to the advertisement. The person is also wearing a black outfit, which contrasts with the white background, making the person stand out. Additionally, the image includes a variety of makeup products, which are displayed in an organized and visually appealing manner. The combination of the person's pose, the contrasting colors, and the well-organized display of products all contribute to making the right image more creative and eye-catching.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative.

The left image, on the other hand, shows a more mundane scene of a person using a laptop, which is a common sight and does not stand out as much. The unusual and unexpected nature of the right image is likely to grab people's attention and make them curious about the product being advertised.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because it features a close-up of a red octopus with a camera, which is an unusual and eye-catching combination. The left image, on the other hand, is a more typical advertisement with a baby and a cityscape. While it is visually appealing, it does not have the same level of uniqueness and surprise that the octopus image does.

Answer: 2

Explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because the right image features a boat, which is an unusual and eye-catching element in an advertisement for makeup. The boat adds a unique and interesting visual element that stands out from the typical makeup advertisement. In contrast, the left image features a more conventional and predictable layout with a focus on the makeup products themselves. While the products are important, the inclusion of the boat in the right image makes it more memorable and engaging for potential customers.

The use of colorful makeup products and the inclusion of a model wearing makeup also make the advertisement visually appealing and engaging. The left image, on the other hand, appears to be an older advertisement with a more monochromatic and less detailed design.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative.

The combination of a modern-day setting with a vintage advertisement creates a contrast that can be visually appealing and intriguing to viewers.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because it features a close-up of a red octopus with a camera, which is an unusual and eye-catching sight. The left image, on the other hand, shows a beach scene with various vehicles, which is a more common and less striking image. The unusual and unexpected nature of the octopus with a camera makes the right image more likely to grab attention and stand out from other advertisements.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because it features a split image of a man and a woman, with the man's face altered to look like a panda. This unusual and unexpected visual element is likely to grab people's attention and make them curious about the advertisement. The left image, while featuring a woman with a strong expression, does not have such a striking visual element.
