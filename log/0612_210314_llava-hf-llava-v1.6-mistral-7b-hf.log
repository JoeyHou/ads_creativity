answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because it features a person skiing on a mountain, which is an exciting and adventurous activity. The image also includes a can of soda, which is a product that many people are familiar with and enjoy. The combination of the adventurous activity and the familiar product creates a visually appealing and engaging advertisement that is likely to capture people's attention.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. It features a diverse range of makeup products, including eyeshadows, lipsticks, and brushes, and it uses a combination of bold colors, text, and images to showcase the products. The left image, while visually appealing, does not have as much variety in terms of product types and does not use as many design elements to draw attention.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because it features a person skiing on a mountain, which is an exciting and adventurous activity. The image on the left shows a person sitting at a desk using a computer, which is a more mundane and everyday activity. The contrast between the two images, with one depicting an exciting outdoor activity and the other depicting a more sedentary indoor activity, creates a stronger visual impact and is more likely to grab people's attention.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because it features a baby with a Coca-Cola bottle on its head, which is an unusual and eye-catching visual. The baby's innocent and surprised expression adds to the novelty and humor of the advertisement. In contrast, the left image shows a hand holding a can of Coca-Cola, which is a more common and less visually striking scene.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. It features a close-up of a Coca-Cola bottle with a playful octopus wrapped around it, which is an unusual and eye-catching combination. The octopus adds a whimsical and fun element to the advertisement, making it more memorable and engaging than the left image, which appears to be a more straightforward and less visually interesting presentation of a Coca-Cola bottle.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more likely to succeed in catching people's eyes by being creative. This is because it features a modern scene with a woman using a laptop, which is a common and relatable activity for many people. The image on the left, on the other hand, features a vintage scene with a man and a child, which may not be as relatable or engaging for a modern audience. The use of a laptop in the right image also suggests that the product being advertised is relevant to contemporary technology and communication.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more abnormal and unusual because it features a person skiing while holding a Coca-Cola bottle. This is an unusual combination of activities, as skiing is typically associated with cold weather and physical exertion, while drinking Coca-Cola is generally associated with relaxation and leisure. The image on the left, on the other hand, features a child with a Coca-Cola bottle on their head, which is a more common and less surprising image.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more abnormal and unusual because it features a person holding a can of beer with a hand that appears to be made of plastic or a similar material. This is not a typical sight and is likely intended to be humorous or attention-grabbing. The left image, on the other hand, shows a person skiing, which is a more typical and expected sight in an advertisement for a product related to skiing.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more abnormal and unusual because it features a cow sitting at a laptop, which is an unexpected and humorous sight.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more abnormal and unusual because it features a person skiing with squirrels. This is an unusual sight because squirrels are not typically seen skiing with humans. The image is likely meant to be humorous or to grab attention, but it is certainly not a common occurrence.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more abnormal and unusual because it features a person skiing on a mountain while holding a bucket of fried chicken. This is an unusual combination of activities, as skiing is typically associated with cold weather and outdoor sports, while eating fried chicken is generally considered an indoor activity. The image is likely intended to be humorous or to grab attention, but it is certainly out of the ordinary.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more unique compared with other ads in the same product category because it features a baby with a Coca-Cola bottle on its head, which is an unusual and eye-catching visual.

answer: 2; explanation: The right image is more unique compared with other ads in the same product category because it features a creative and unusual design with multiple squirrels in various sizes and positions. This design is visually striking and memorable, which sets it apart from more conventional ads that typically feature a single product or a single person. The use of squirrels as the main subject matter also adds a playful and whimsical element to the ad, which can make it more engaging and appealing to potential customers.
