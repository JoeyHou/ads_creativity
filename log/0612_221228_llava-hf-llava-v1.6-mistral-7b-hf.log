answer: 3; explanation: The visual advertisement is very creative. It features a person skiing on a mountain, with the words "KIT CAN BREATHE" written on the image. This is a clever play on words, as "kit" refers to a skiing equipment, and "can breathe" is a phrase that suggests the equipment is lightweight and comfortable to wear. The advertisement also includes a tagline that reads "HER LOCKOFF JACKET'S BREATHABLE THREE-LAYER GORE-TEX PRO SHELL ALLOWS MOISTURE TO ESCAPE SO SHE CAN KEEP MOVING," which further emphasizes the breathability of the jacket. The use of a mountainous background and the person skiing adds to the visual appeal of the advertisement, making it stand out and effectively communicate the product's features.

answer: 2; explanation: The advertisement features a person skiing on a snowy mountain, which is a typical scene for a skiing advertisement. However, the text "KIT CAN BREATHE" is unusual because it is not a common phrase or connotation associated with skiing or outdoor activities. This phrase is likely a creative or catchy slogan for the product being advertised, which is not immediately clear from the image.
