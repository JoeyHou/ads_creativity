reasoning: The advertisement features a person skiing on a snowy mountain, which is a typical scene for skiing-related products. However, the unusual aspect is the presence of a red apple in the image, which is not a typical object associated with skiing or winter sports.
answer: 2"," 2; explanation: the advertisement uses a combination of a person skiing and a person breathing, which suggests a connection between skiing and breathing. this is somewhat unusual as the primary focus of skiing is typically on physical activity and movement down a slope. the inclusion of breathing might be seen as a stretch in terms of the usual themes associated with skiing, but it does not reach the level of being very unusual, as it can still be interpreted as a metaphor or a creative approach to the sport."

reasoning: The advertisement features a baby with a Coca-Cola bottle on its head, which is an unusual and atypical connotation for a product advertisement.
answer: 3"," 2; explanation: the advertisement is unusual because it features a baby wearing a coca-cola bottle cap as a hat. this is an atypical and playful depiction of a product, as it is not common to see a baby wearing a paper hat with a bottle cap as part of the design. the use of a baby in advertising can also evoke emotions and create a sense of nostalgia, which may be the intention of the advertisement. however, it is not entirely out of the ordinary for advertisements to be creative and unconventional in their visuals to grab attention, so it's a mild form of unusualness on a scale of 1 to 3."

reasoning: The advertisement features a cow sitting at a laptop, which is an unusual and humorous concept as cows are not known to use technology.
answer: 3"," 3; explanation: the advertisement features a cow with a laptop, which is an unusual and abnormal combination. cows are not typically associated with technology or computers, and the image of a cow sitting at a desk with a laptop implies a humorous and absurd context. this juxtaposition of an animal and a human object is meant to be comical and memorable, potentially drawing attention to the ad and encouraging viewers to think about the product being promoted."

reasoning: The advertisement features a man holding a bucket of fries with the KFC logo, and the text ""Messi Baba and the 40 defenders"" is displayed. The unusual aspect is the combination of a soccer player with a fast-food brand, which is not a typical association.
answer: 3"," 3; explanation: the image features a manipulated depiction of lionel messi holding a bucket of kfc fried chicken. this is considered unusual because lionel messi is a professional soccer player and is not associated with kfc or fast food in general. the image has been created to create a humorous effect, combining the well-known soccer player with a brand logo in a way that is unconventional and not typical of the usual brand advertisement."

answer: 3"," 3; explanation: the advertisement features human shaped silhouettes made of a glossy material, possibly plastic, performing ballet poses. the unusual aspect of this advertisement is the combination of ballet, typically an art form associated with grace and elegance, with the concept of plastic, which is often associated with artificiality and mass-production. this juxtaposition creates an unexpected and thought-provoking image that captures the viewer's attention."
0/85300.jpg,"
reasoning: The advertisement features a baby with a QR code, which is not a typical element in a baby advertisement.
answer: 3"," 2; explanation: the image advertisement is a composite of two photographs, which is not unusual. however, the juxtaposition of a baby with a travel-themed advertisement is not a typical pairing, which could be considered somewhat unusual. generally, baby advertisements are expected to have more direct, playful, or cute imagery that appeals to both parents and the general public. this combination might be seen as a creative approach to advertising, but it is not entirely typical."
0/95250.jpg,"
reasoning: The advertisement features a large ship pulling a much smaller boat, which is an unusual and atypical depiction of maritime scenarios. In reality, ships do not pull smaller boats. The image is likely stylized for artistic or symbolic purposes.
answer: 3"," 2; explanation: the advertisement features a very large ship and a very small boat, which is unusual in the sense that the boat is toy-like in comparison to the massive ship. this creates an interesting visual contrast and emphasizes the scale difference between the two. however, the overall concept seems to be a normal depiction of brands guiding other brands since 1955, which is the text provided on the advertisement. the image does not contain any abnormal objects or atypical connotations, so it would be considered neutral on the scale of 1 to 3 in terms of normality."
1/108011.jpg,"
reasoning: The advertisement features a woman sitting on a giant Nivea-Creme bottle in the ocean, surrounded by other people.

Additionally, the presence of a giant bottle in the ocean is not a common occurrence.
answer: 3"," 3; explanation: the advertisement is unusual because it depicts a group of people in bathing suits standing around a large barrel with the word ""nivea-cr√®me"" written on it, which is not a typical advertisement scene. usually, products are advertised in more visually appealing and relevant ways, but in this case, the scene is unconventional and atypical for an advertisement. the presence of the barrel and people in bathing suits suggests a humorous or satirical message rather than a direct product promotion. as a result, the advertisement stands out as very unusual compared to standard advertising practices."
1/112831.jpg,"
reasoning: The advertisement features a red octopus with its tentacles wrapped around a digital camera, which is an unusual and atypical connotation for a camera advertisement. Typically, camera advertisements showcase the camera's features and design, but in this case, the octopus is the central focus, which is not a common sight in camera advertisements.

answer: 3"," 3; explanation: this advertisement is very unusual because it features a red octopus with numerous tentacles around a camera, which is not a typical representation of a product. the inclusion of the octopus and the red color adds a fantastical or surreal element to the advertisement, which is atypical for product promotion. the juxtaposition of everyday items like a camera with the extraordinary and unexpected presence of an octopus creates a striking and memorable visual."
1/116521.jpg,"
reasoning: The advertisement features a woman with a tattoo on her face, a man with long hair, and a dog, all of which are not typical elements in a standard advertisement. The text ""Canada's Club Scene Sucks"" is also unusual as it is a bold statement that could be considered controversial.
answer: 3"," 3; explanation: the advertisement is unusual because it features a combination of elements that are not typically associated with each other. it includes two different individuals with separate messages, one being a woman and the other being a man. additionally, the text ""canada's club scene sucks"" is juxtaposed with the image of a baby seal, which is an animal often associated with canada and is known for being hunted. the blending of these elements creates an unexpected and provocative message, making the advertisement quite unusual."
1/119501.jpg,"

1/121071.jpg,"
reasoning: The advertisement features a shoe with a red sole, which is not a typical color for a shoe sole. The red sole is often associated with a different brand, and the use of this color in a Puma advertisement is unusual.
answer: 2"," 2; explanation: the advertisement is quite unusual as it prominently showcases a single shoe, which is not a typical way of advertising a product. the focus on a single shoe can be seen as odd because usually, product ads show the entire product line or different angles of the product to give an idea of its design and features. however, this advertisement is in the form of a comparison between different types of shoes, which is not so unusual. the shoe is displayed in three different orientations, which is not very uncommon, but combined with the emphasis on a single shoe, it stands out as unusual. overall, the advertisement is a blend of normal and unusual elements."

1/84431.jpg,"
reasoning: The advertisement features a woman with a very intense gaze and a chocolate-colored background, which is not typical for hair color advertisements.

answer: 2"," 1; explanation: the advertisement features a woman with chocolate-colored hair and a seductive smile, which is a common theme for beauty and hair products. the text in the advertisement highlights the richness of color, triple protection, and zero greys, which are all typical selling points for hair color. the presence of multiple bottles indicates that there is more than one product available for sale. the overall composition of the advertisement is typical for beauty product marketing, and there is nothing particularly unusual or atypical about it."
2/122412.jpg,"
reasoning: The advertisement features a woman in a black dress and hat, holding a black dog on a leash. The unusual aspect is the presence of a black dog, which is not a typical color for dogs. Most dogs are brown, black, or white. The black dog adds a unique and striking visual element to the advertisement.

answer: 2"," 3; explanation: the advertisement features an image of a person in a black dress and black hat, holding a black dog on a leash. the unusual aspect is the repetition of the color black; both the person and the dog are black, which could be seen as an atypical choice for advertising fashion or clothing, as colors are generally chosen to attract attention and represent the brand or its products."
2/124812.jpg,"
reasoning: The advertisement features a silver Audi car with a smartphone displaying a map and navigation app, suggesting that the car has advanced technology and connectivity features. The text ""Why Choose a Silvercar?"" implies that the car is a silver Audi, which is a luxury vehicle.

answer: 2"," 1; explanation: the image features a silver car, which appears to be a modern and luxurious model. the ad is well-designed with a clean layout and a clear message about the car's features. however, there is a small image of a mobile phone on the left side, which could be considered unusual for a car advertisement. typically, mobile phones are not directly associated with cars, and their inclusion might be an attempt to imply that the car is equipped with the latest technology or smart features. overall, the image is straightforward and not highly unusual."
2/18052.jpg,"reasoning: The image shows two people sitting closely together at a table, with one person using a laptop and the other person looking at a tablet. The unusual aspect of this advertisement is the presence of a third person, who appears to be a small child, sitting on the lap of the person using the laptop. This is not a typical scene for a professional or work-related setting, as it is uncommon to have a child present during work or office tasks.
answer: 3"," 2; explanation: the image depicts a mother helping her daughter with homework, which is a very common and typical scenario. the image does not contain any unusual objects or atypical connotations. it is just a representation of a regular family situation. both the mother and daughter are seated at a table with a laptop, books, and paperwork, which is a common setting for studying or doing homework. the scene is ordinary and doesn't contain anything out of the ordinary, so the score is 2 out of 3."

reasoning: The advertisement features a group of people with surfboards, which is an unusual and atypical connotation for a car dealership.
answer: 3"," 2; explanation: the advertisement features an image of people carrying surfboards and standing next to honda and other cars. the presence of surfboards and the beach setting suggests that the advertisement is promoting vehicles that are suitable for beachside activities or a fun, leisurely lifestyle. the unusual aspect of this advertisement is that it is not common to see cars being associated with beach-related activities. cars are typically associated with more practical tasks such as daily commuting or traveling to work. however, the advertisement manages to convey the message that these cars are suitable for a more adventurous and fun-filled lifestyle."
